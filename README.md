## What is this?

**MoonGUI** is a modern framework for Lua applications. It uses JavaFX as its backend.  
This system solves almost all GUI-related problems for Lua developers who don't have access to a native GUI toolkit.  
This project is still in **BETA**, which means **it may not work as expected**.

## How to use

To use MoonGUI, you can either run the provided `.exe` or set `moongui` as a system environment command.

Check the version:

```shell
moongui -v
````

Help menu:

```shell
moongui -h
```

Run your MoonGUI application:

```shell
moongui <filename.lua>
```
